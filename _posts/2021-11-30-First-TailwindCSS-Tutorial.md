After another discussion with my mentor, I have decided that it would make sense to work with a couple of different framework examples and settings separate sites to fully experience working with TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. 

Having experience with these two popular CSS frameworks will be beneficial knowledge in the future, even if I donâ€™t use them that much in all of my work.

I spent today taking a crash course in TailwindCSS. I found a 30 minute video on YouTube from Traversy Media that gave a good high-level overview. I went through the process of setting up Tailwind, creating the config file, and working on some utility classes.

I will need to learn more about TailwindCSS in greater detail, but this proved to be a good foundation.

A similar video and process will be necessary to learning Bootstrap. I am still looking at the YouTube video options for that framework.
