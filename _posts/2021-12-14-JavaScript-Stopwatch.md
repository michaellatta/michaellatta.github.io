I am trying to go back to basics with my learning and to push out a small project to keep up the positive momentum.

Today I am building a very simple JavaScript stopwatch. This is the first step in a series of small Projects to help master JavaScript better.

I am doing more of these mini projects as I feel it helps to have a sense of accomplishment over still being stuck working through the massive freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum.

I discussed this project in greater detail during my pairing session with my mentor. We compared using loops versus the setInterval method that is built into JavaScript. I am ultimately going to use the setInterval method for this project, but the use of loops is possibly something I might try with another copy of this project just to compare the experience.

I am using this YouTube video as a starting point.

While I am not following this example exactly, it serves as a good example.
