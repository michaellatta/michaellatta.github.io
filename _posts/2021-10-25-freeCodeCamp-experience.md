From the start of my developer journey, I have been using the website freeCodeCamp.org. This site has been very beneficial in learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility, and general web design.

freeCodeCamp has been positive for me. I am appreciative of having access to these coding courses and to the community of fellow coders.
