After doing some more research on possible frameworks to use, I am feeling a little hesitant. There is a lot of pushback among designers and developers that frameworks are not a good idea and that using vanilla CSS is a better practice.

I found a good video on YouTube that broke down the differences.

I think it is still beneficial to have an understanding of a framework and respect their utility in a given situation, but I will try to stick to a little more custom CSS with this website.

Tailwind CSS still has more appeal to me over Bootstrap. Tailwind allows for more customization and flexibility over Bootstrap.

I also spent some time starting a 30 minute tutorial on React. Unfortunately, I ran into some issues where I could not get the initial React files to load in the browser. A simple search or the error message that was being displayed in the terminal led me to a Stack Overflow article that provided a solution. I now have the initial React app up and running and will continue with the tutorial tomorrow.
