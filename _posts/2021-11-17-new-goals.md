Today I was fortunate to have a pairing session and discuss my current site and my learning path. This was a very positive experience!

I now have a better idea of goals for the near future of my development career.

These goals include:

1. Incorporate Tailwind CSS into this portfolio website.
2. Setup the Esty presence for Latta Laser Creations.
3. Secure the domain for Latta Laser Creations.
4. Continue the JavaScript certification on freeCodeCamp.
5. Create a JavaScript program.
6. Post on the blog more frequently!

One of the big takeaways from my pairing session is that it is important to keep the learning momentum going! Posting to this blog frequently is one of the easier steps on that journey.
